# Sorting-game

This is a game that I created in Python to help me in two primary ways
    1. Better understand fundamental sorting algorithms
    2. Better understand programming GUIs in Python

Even though the first portion of the game only incorporates Insertion Sort, I am planning on making other versions that incorporate more complex sorting algorithms and applications
